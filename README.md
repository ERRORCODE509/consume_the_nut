# ***consume_the_nut***
## *Giving you a use for that half-ton of pine nuts.*

This mod addes more uses for all of those pine nuts you've managed to collect. Options include pine nut milk, pine nut pulp (the byproduct of pine nut milk), pine nut ambrosia, pine nut butter, and pine nut meal. Provided that I managed to code things right, pine nut butter should be usable as peanutbutter in recipes, and pine nut meal should be usable to make flour and bread flour. It case it wasn't already apparent, this mod is meant to be used with my previous pine nut mods.
